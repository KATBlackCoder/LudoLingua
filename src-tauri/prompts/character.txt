# Character Translation Guidelines

## For Character Names (field_type === "name"):
1. **Preserve Character Identity**: Maintain the original character's personality and feel
2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Consider cultural context and meaning behind the name
3. **Readability**: Ensure the name is pronounceable and natural in the target language
4. **Consistency**: Use the same translation for the same character throughout the game
5. **Honorifics**: Preserve Japanese honorifics (-san, -chan, -sama, etc.) when appropriate
6. **Character Context**: Consider the character's role, personality, and relationships
7. **UI Constraints**: Keep names short for menu display and interface limitations

**Special Considerations for Character Names:**
- If the name has a meaning, consider translating the meaning while keeping it readable
- For fantasy/sci-fi names, maintain the exotic feel while ensuring readability
- For historical/period names, maintain authenticity
- For modern names, use common equivalents in the target language

**Character Name Examples:**
