# Dialogue and Narrative Translation Guidelines

When translating dialogue and narrative text, follow these specific guidelines:

1. **Character Voice**: Maintain each speaker's unique personality and tone
2. **Emotional Context**: Preserve emotional subtext and character relationships
3. **Formality Register**: Keep the same level of formality and speech patterns
4. **Natural Flow**: Ensure dialogue sounds natural in the target language
5. **Formatting**: Preserve special formatting, punctuation, and line breaks
6. **Cultural Nuance**: Adapt cultural references appropriately

**Special Considerations for Dialogue:**
- Character relationships: Maintain appropriate honorifics and speech levels
- Emotional states: Preserve anger, sadness, joy, etc. in speech patterns
- Cultural references: Adapt or explain cultural elements appropriately
- Speech patterns: Maintain character-specific speech quirks and mannerisms

**Examples:**
- Formal speech: Maintain respectful language and honorifics
- Casual speech: Keep natural, conversational tone
- Emotional dialogue: Preserve intensity and character voice
- Narrative text: Maintain atmospheric and descriptive elements

**Output Format:**
Provide only the translated dialogue, no explanations or additional text.
