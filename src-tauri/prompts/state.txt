# Status Effect (State) Translation Guidelines

## For Status Effect Names:
1. **RPG Terminology**: Use consistent RPG status effect terminology
2. **Battle Context**: Consider the battle/combat context of the effect
3. **Clarity**: Ensure the name clearly indicates what the effect does
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with similar effects in the game
5. **Cultural Adaptation**: Use familiar RPG terms for the target audience
6. **Conciseness**: Keep names short and memorable for battle UI

**Special Considerations for Status Effect Names:**
- Combat effects: Use action-oriented, clear terminology
- Duration effects: Indicate if temporary or permanent
- Intensity levels: Consider severity (poison vs. deadly poison)
- RPG conventions: Use familiar terms (poison, sleep, confusion, etc.)

**Status Effect Name Examples:**
- "毒" => "Poison"
- "睡眠" => "Sleep"
- "混乱" => "Confusion"
- "防御" => "Defense"
- "不死身" => "Immortal"

## For Status Effect Descriptions:
1. **Mechanical Clarity**: Clearly explain what the effect does
2. **Game Balance**: Maintain the intended game balance implications
3. **Player Understanding**: Ensure players understand the effect's impact
4. **Consistency**: Keep consistent with similar effect descriptions
5. **Conciseness**: Be clear and concise for UI display
6. **Technical Accuracy**: Preserve important mechanical details

**Special Considerations for Status Effect Descriptions:**
- Duration: Clearly indicate how long the effect lasts
- Effects: Explain what changes (stats, behavior, etc.)
- Removal: Mention how the effect can be removed
- Stacking: Indicate if effects can stack or overlap

**Status Effect Description Examples:**
- "Damages the target over time" => "Damages the target over time"
- "Prevents the target from acting" => "Prevents the target from acting"
- "Increases defense temporarily" => "Increases defense temporarily"

## For Battle Messages:
1. **Placeholder Preservation**: Maintain all placeholders (%1, %2, %3, etc.)
2. **Battle Intensity**: Keep the action-oriented, dramatic battle tone
3. **Character Integration**: Ensure character names integrate naturally
4. **Clarity**: Make the message clear even in fast-paced battle
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent battle message style
6. **Context Awareness**: Consider the specific battle context

**Special Considerations for Battle Messages:**
- Message1 (Applied to target): "X has been affected!"
- Message2 (Applied by user): "X affected Y!"
- Message3 (Active state): "X is currently affected"
- Message4 (Removed): "X's effect has been cured!"

**Battle Message Examples:**
- "は毒にかかった！" => "%1 has been poisoned!"
- "に毒をかけた！" => "%1 poisoned %2!"
- "は眠っている。" => "%1 is sleeping."
- "の毒が消えた！" => "%1's poison has been cured!"
- "は我に返った！" => "%1 has come to their senses!"
- "は目を覚ました！" => "%1 has woken up!"

## For Developer Notes:
1. **Technical Preservation**: Maintain important technical information
2. **Developer Context**: Keep developer-specific information intact
3. **Formatting**: Preserve any special formatting or structure
4. **Reference Integrity**: Maintain important references and links
5. **Clarity**: Ensure technical information remains clear

**Special Considerations for Developer Notes:**
- Technical references: Maintain precise technical information
- Game mechanics: Preserve important game system details
- Debug information: Keep debugging and testing information
- Implementation notes: Maintain development context

**Developer Note Examples:**
- "ステート１番はＨＰが０になったときに自動的に付加されます。" => "State 1 is automatically applied when HP reaches 0."
- "Debug: State testing" => "Debug: State testing"

## For All Status Effect Text:
