**✅ Backend Implementation (Complete):**
1. ✅ Created `src-tauri/src/commands/translations.rs` (CRUD commands)
2. ✅ Enhanced `src-tauri/src/db/translation/repo.rs` (database operations)
3. ✅ Added project management commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/engine.rs`
4. ✅ Fixed database schema constraints for legitimate duplicate text storage
5. ✅ Registered all commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/handler.rs`

**✅ Frontend Implementation (Complete):**
6. ✅ Created `app/stores/translations.ts` (state management)
7. ✅ Created `app/composables/useTranslations.ts` (UI logic)
8. ✅ Created `app/components/translations/` directory
9. ✅ Built `TranslationTable.vue` with full functionality
10. ✅ Built `TranslationForm.vue` for editing
11. ✅ Created `app/pages/translations.vue` page
12. ✅ Added navigation integration to `AppHeader.vue`

**✅ Advanced Features (Complete):**

14. ✅ Implemented working actions column with edit/delete buttons
15. ✅ Fixed native Tauri dialog confirmations for reliable operations
16. ✅ Updated all icons from Heroicons to Lucide for consistency
17. ✅ Implemented row selection with checkboxes and bulk operations
18. ✅ Added project selection dropdown and delete project functionality
19. ✅ Enhanced about page with comprehensive translation management information
20. ✅ Fixed navigation flow (translations page routes to home, not translator)
21. ✅ Added conditional translator link visibility (only when project loaded)

**✅ Database & Infrastructure (Complete):**
22. ✅ Fixed critical `UNIQUE constraint failed` error affecting text storage
23. ✅ Created migration `0004_fix_text_units_uniqueness.sql` to remove restrictive constraints
24. ✅ Updated repository code to allow legitimate duplicate text storage
25. ✅ Verified all project loading and text extraction works correctly

**Result:** Complete, production-ready translation management system with advanced features!
