- ✅ **Smart record matching**: Uses database ID or content matching as fallback
- ✅ **Proper error handling**: Graceful fallback when records can't be found

#### **Complete Implementation**:
- [x] **Modified `extract_text_from_files` in `engine.rs`**
  - [x] Uses `bulk_upsert_units()` to save ALL extracted text units to database
  - [x] Sets status to "NotTranslated" for fresh extractions
  - [x] Includes manifest hash for project identification

- ✅ **Mixed State Handling**: Full support for projects with both raw and translated content
- ✅ **Zero-manual-step UX**: Everything happens automatically!

### Phase 3C: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Simple Direct Export (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
- [x] **CANCELLED**: Complex manifest-driven approach (over-engineered)
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX: Remove Custom Export Location Dialog**
  - [x] **Problem**: Current `exportSubset()` in `translation.vue` uses dialog to let users choose ANY folder
  - [x] **Issue**: This breaks `EngineCriteria` paths when copied to custom locations
  - [x] **Solution**: Change to FIXED location export (`project/ludolingua/`)
  - [x] **Update `exportSubset()`**: Remove dialog, always export to `project/ludolingua/`
  - [x] **Benefits**: Criteria paths remain valid, no path mismatch issues
  - [x] **Implementation**: Use `engineStore.projectInfo?.path` + `/ludolingua` for fixed location
  - [x] **Clean Code**: Removed unused `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` import
- [x] **Add useAppToast to translation.vue**
  - [x] Import `useAppToast` composable from `~/composables/useAppToast`
  - [x] Initialize toast functionality for export success/error feedback
  - [x] Replace console.log/error with proper toast notifications
  - [x] Add success toast when export completes successfully
  - [x] Add error toast for export failures with user-friendly messages
- [x] **Fix Linter Errors in translation.vue**
  - [x] Remove unused `determineInitialMode` import (linter error)
  - [x] Ensure all imports are properly used or prefixed with underscore if intentionally unused
- [x] **Implement Direct Database-Driven Export**
  - [x] **Use Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage current EngineInfo, database, and factory
  - [x] **Simple Process**: Query database → Get engine from factory → Inject translations
  - [x] **No Re-detection**: Use passed EngineInfo instead of re-detecting engine type
  - [x] **Clean Implementation**: Direct injection without temporary file complexity
  - [x] **Engine-Agnostic**: Added `reconstruct_text_unit_id()` with per-engine logic
  - [x] **Extensible**: Easy to add new engines (RPG Maker MZ, Wolf RPG, etc.)
- [x] **Add Export Function to Database Module**
  - [x] Add `find_translated_units_for_export()` function in `src-tauri/src/db/translation/repo.rs`
  - [x] Query for units with status 'MachineTranslated' OR 'HumanReviewed'
  - [x] Filter by manifest_hash to ensure project-specific results
  - [x] Return all translated units ready for injection
- [x] **Refactored Export to Factory Pattern**
  - [x] Moved `export_translated_subset` to `factory.rs` for engine-agnostic dispatch
  - [x] Command handler in `engine.rs` now delegates to factory function
  - [x] **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**: All engine dispatch centralized in factory
  - [x] **MAINTAINABLE**: Adding new engines requires no changes to export logic
  - [x] **CONSISTENT**: Follows same pattern as `extract_game_data_files`
- [x] **Test Simple Export Functionality**
  - [x] Create test project with translations
  - [x] Verify export works with fixed location
  - [x] Verify translations are properly injected into exported files
  - [x] Verify original project files remain unchanged
  - [x] Test with different engine types (MV, MZ) - **WORKING** ✅

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Architecture Decisions
- **Factory Pattern**: Export logic centralized in `factory.rs` for clean engine dispatch
- **Direct Database Export**: Query translations directly from database without complex file operations
- **Fixed Export Location**: Always export to `project/ludolingua/` to maintain EngineCriteria path validity
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage current EngineInfo, database, and factory instead of reinventing
- **Simple Process**: Database query → Engine injection → Clean export (no temporary files)
- **Database First**: All translations stored in SQLite with manifest hash linking
- **Engine Agnostic**: Each engine implements `reconstruct_text_unit_id()` for its own ID format
- **Open-Closed Principle**: New engines don't require changes to export logic
- **Clean Implementation**: Direct injection without unnecessary complexity
- **Consistent Patterns**: Export follows same factory pattern as `extract_game_data_files`

### Code Quality Goals ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Reduce complexity**: From 450 lines to 344 lines in engine.rs (24% reduction) ✅
- **Handler cleanup**: From 222 lines to 217 lines in handler.rs (2.5% reduction) ✅
- **Function consolidation**: From 15 functions to 10 functions in engine.rs (33% reduction) ✅
- **Improve maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with unified functions ✅
- **Better error handling**: Standardized patterns with manual AppError→String conversion ✅
- **Performance**: Efficient database operations and cleaner merge logic ✅
- **Consistent patterns**: Unified logging, error handling, and command organization ✅

### Key Technical Insights
- **Engine-Agnostic Export**: Each engine implements `reconstruct_text_unit_id()` method
  - **Open-Closed Principle**: New engines don't break existing export logic
  - **Self-Contained**: Each engine handles its own ID reconstruction
  - **Extensible**: Easy to add new engines without touching export code
  - **Type-Safe**: Compile-time guarantees that all engines implement the method
- **Trait-Based Design**: Engine trait now includes export-specific methods
  - `reconstruct_text_unit_id()`: Converts field_type strings to proper TextUnit IDs
  - Automatic engine dispatch via existing factory pattern
  - No manual engine type checking in export logic
- **Simplified Export Process**: Direct database → engine injection without temporary file complexity
- **Field Type Mapping**: `field_type` format `"field:file.json:index"` enables precise translation injection
  - Example: `"name:www/data/Actors.json:1"` maps to character name in first record
  - Database query returns all translations, field_type provides GPS coordinates for each
  - Eliminates ambiguity in translation-to-file mapping during export injection
- **File Touch Specification**:
  - **CREATED**: `project/ludolingua/` directory with translated files
  - **MODIFIED**: Only the translatable JSON files get translations injected
  - **UNCHANGED**: Original project files remain completely untouched
  - **FINAL RESULT**: Clean export folder with translated game data

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Full export workflow
- **Performance tests**: Large project handling
- **Cross-platform tests**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility
