## Completed Achievements (MVP)

### âœ… Phase 1-5: Complete MVP
- [x] **Core Architecture:** Rust + Tauri backend, Nuxt.js frontend
- [x] **RPG Maker MV Support:** All 12 file types implemented
  - [x] Actors.json, Items.json, Skills.json, Weapons.json, Armors.json, Classes.json
  - [x] System.json, States.json, Enemies.json, CommonEvents.json, Troops.json, MapXXX.json
- [x] **AI Translation:** Ollama integration with context-aware prompts
- [x] **Smart Content Filtering:** Technical content filtering for quality
- [x] **Professional UI:** Nuxt UI components with responsive design
- [x] **Settings Management:** Persistent configuration with Tauri Store
- [x] **Translation Workflow:** Complete extract â†’ translate â†’ inject pipeline

## Quick Reference

### Architecture
- **Backend:** Rust + Tauri with trait-based engine system
- **Frontend:** Nuxt.js + Pinia stores (migrating to Nuxt 4 + PrimeVue)
- **LLM:** Ollama integration with JSON model configs
- **Storage:** Tauri Store plugin for settings

### File Structure
```
src-tauri/src/engines/rpg_maker_mv/files/
â”œâ”€â”€ actors.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ items.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ skills.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ weapons.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ armors.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ classes.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ system.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ states.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ enemies.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ common_events.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ troops.rs âœ…
â””â”€â”€ maps.rs âœ…
```

### Implementation Pattern
Each file follows the same pattern:
1. Define structs matching JSON structure
2. Implement `extract_text()` function using common helpers
3. Implement `inject_translations()` function using common helpers
4. Add to engine file detection
5. Use appropriate prompt types (State, System, Character, etc.)
6. Test with sample project

### Prompt System
- **Base:** `basic.txt` (streamlined core guidelines)
- **Specialized:** `character.txt`, `equipment.txt`, `skill.txt`, `dialogue.txt`, `state.txt`, etc.
- **Vocabulary:** `vocabularies.txt` (game-specific terms)
- **Features:** Direct translation mappings, flexible guidelines, aggressive output formatting

## Key Decisions

### âœ… Completed Optimizations
- **Prompt System:** Consolidated equipment prompts, added specific mappings
- **UI/UX:** Load New Project button, Reset functionality, improved workflow
- **Architecture:** Common helper functions, ~70% code reduction
- **LLM:** Best-of-breed approach with ollama-rs crate
- **Content Filtering:** Smart filtering to reduce translation noise

### ðŸ”„ Current Approach
- **Platform Upgrade:** Nuxt 4 + PrimeVue migration for enhanced capabilities
- **Data Table Focus:** Advanced table features for better translation management
- **Performance:** Backend optimizations for large-scale projects
- **User Experience:** Modern UI/UX with professional-grade components

## Future Considerations
- **RPG Maker MZ Support** - After platform upgrade completion
- **Additional Engines** - Wolf RPG, etc.
- **Advanced Features** - Batch translation per file type, filtering UI
- **Distribution** - Cross-platform builds and auto-update system
