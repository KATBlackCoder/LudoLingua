## üìù **Development Notes**

### **Architecture Patterns Established:**
- **Naming Convention**: `translator` (workflow) vs `translations` (management)
- **Component Pattern**: Follow `GlossaryTable.vue` and `GlossaryForm.vue` proven patterns
- **State Management**: Pinia stores + composables + components architecture
- **Icon System**: Lucide icons for Nuxt UI v4 consistency
- **Database Design**: Flexible schema allowing legitimate duplicates in RPG game text
- **Text Processing**: Unified `utils/text/` utility with automatic Engine trait integration
  - **Automatic Processing**: Engines get text processing for free via trait default implementations
  - **Global Consistency**: Same utility applied to all engines without manual calls
  - **Future-Proof**: New engines inherit text processing capabilities automatically
  - **Engine Agnostic**: Works for all current and future engines without modification

### **Quality Standards:**
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Clean, consistent code structure
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with native dialogs
- ‚úÖ Responsive design with proper spacing
- ‚úÖ Modern UI patterns and best practices

**üèÜ Status**: Phase 5 complete! All enhanced features and polish objectives achieved. Ready for Phase 6 - Advanced Features & Polish.
