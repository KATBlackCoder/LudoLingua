## üö® Critical Refactoring Tasks

### Component Architecture Refactoring
**Priority: HIGH** - Components are too large and violate DRY principles

#### Current Issues:
- `TranslationResult.vue`: 812 lines (should be ~200)
- ‚úÖ `TranslationTable.vue`: Removed (replaced by modern `TranslationView.vue`) 
- `GlossaryTable.vue`: 282 lines (should be ~100)
- Duplicated code across 5 table components
- 5x fullscreen detection logic duplication
- 4x pagination logic duplication
- 4x table header duplication

#### Refactoring Tasks:

##### 1. Create Shared Composables ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] `composables/useFullscreen.ts` - Extract fullscreen detection logic
- [x] `composables/usePagination.ts` - Create TanStack Table pagination composable
  - [x] Extract TanStack pagination logic from TranslationResult.vue
  - [x] Create unified pagination interface for all table components
  - [x] Add reactive pagination state management
  - [x] Include pagination options for TanStack Table integration
- [x] `composables/useTableSelection.ts` - Extract row selection logic
  - [x] Create pure selection state management
  - [x] Add TanStack Table selection column factory
  - [x] Include selection utilities (clear, selectAll, etc.)
  - [x] NO bulk actions (separate concern)
- [x] `composables/useBulkActions.ts` - Extract bulk operation logic
  - [x] Create bulk action processor
  - [x] Handle action state (loading, disabled, etc.)
  - [x] Support dynamic action labels with counts
- [x] `composables/useModal.ts` - Extract modal state management
- [x] `utils/table.ts` - Pure table utility functions
  - [x] Table column factory functions (no state)
  - [x] Cell formatting utilities (pure functions)
  - [x] Table validation helpers (pure functions)
- [x] `utils/ui.ts` - Pure UI utility functions
  - [x] Badge color mapping functions (pure)
  - [x] Icon mapping utilities (pure)
  - [x] Text formatting helpers (pure)

##### 2. Create Shared Components ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] `components/shared/FilterCard.vue` - Reusable filter card wrapper
- [x] `components/shared/TableHeader.vue` - Standardized table header with pagination
- [x] `components/shared/BulkActions.vue` - Reusable bulk action alerts
- [x] `components/shared/TableFooter.vue` - Standardized table footer with stats
- [x] `components/shared/ActionButtonGroup.vue` - Reusable action button groups
- [x] `components/shared/DataTable.vue` - Complete table with common features

##### 3. Refactor Existing Components
- [ ] Break down `TranslationResult.vue` into:
  - `TranslationFilters.vue` (~100 lines)
  - ‚úÖ `TranslationTable.vue`: Removed (replaced by modern `TranslationView.vue`) 
  - `BulkActions.vue` (~50 lines)
  - `TranslationRowActions.vue` (~100 lines)
- [x] ‚úÖ `TranslationTable.vue`: Removed (replaced by modern `TranslationView.vue`)
- [ ] Simplify `GlossaryTable.vue` (reduce from 282 to ~100 lines)
- [x] ‚úÖ `TranslationRaw.vue`: Migrated to DataTable component with utility functions
- [x] ‚úÖ `TranslationTable.vue`: Removed (replaced by modern `TranslationView.vue`)
- [ ] Migrate `GlossaryTable.vue` to TanStack Table pagination
- [x] ‚úÖ `TranslationProcess.vue`: Migrated to DataTable component with utility functions
- [ ] Standardize all table components to use TanStack Table

##### 4. Refactor Modal Components
- [ ] Update `TranslationEditor.vue` to use `useModal.ts`
  - [ ] Replace custom modal state with `useModal` composable
  - [ ] Add consistent loading and error states
  - [ ] Standardize modal props and events
- [ ] Update `TranslationForm.vue` to use `useModal.ts`
  - [ ] Replace local state management with `useModal`
  - [ ] Add built-in error handling
  - [ ] Implement consistent form validation
- [ ] Update `GlossaryForm.vue` to use `useModal.ts`
  - [ ] Standardize modal behavior across all forms
  - [ ] Add loading states for async operations
  - [ ] Implement consistent save/cancel patterns
- [ ] Standardize modal props and events across all forms
- [ ] Add consistent loading and error states to all modals
- [ ] Create shared modal utility functions for common patterns

##### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all refactored components individually
- [ ] Verify no functionality is broken
- [ ] Test responsive behavior across screen sizes
- [ ] Validate accessibility features are preserved

#### Expected Benefits:
- **Reduce Total LOC**: From ~2000 lines to ~800 lines
- **Improve Maintainability**: Single source of truth for common patterns
- **Better Testing**: Isolated, focused components with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistent UX**: Standardized table behavior with TanStack Table
- **Performance**: Shared logic, fewer event listeners, optimized pagination
- **Unified API**: All table components use same pagination and selection systems
- **Modular Design**: Separate selection logic from bulk actions for better reusability
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functions like `translation.ts` eliminate code duplication
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified badge colors, icons, and UI patterns across components
- **Modal Consistency**: Standardized modal behavior across all forms with built-in loading/error states
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminate 3x modal state management duplication across form components

#### Progress Status:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1A Complete**: All shared composables and utilities created
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1B Complete**: All shared components created (FilterCard, TableHeader, TableFooter, BulkActions, ActionButtonGroup, DataTable)
- üîÑ **Phase 1C In Progress**: Refactoring existing components
- ‚è≥ **Phase 1D Pending**: Modal component refactoring
- ‚è≥ **Phase 1E Pending**: TanStack Table standardization
