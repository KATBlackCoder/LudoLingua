# LudoLingua Development TODO

## Current Status
**Phase:** Phase 7 - Frontend & Backend Polish  
**Last Completed:** Nuxt 4 + pnpm migration with new directory structure  
**Current Focus:** Frontend & Backend Polish

## Priority Organization

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY (Critical for Phase 7 completion)
**These tasks must be completed first to enable Phase 7 functionality**

#### Backend Core (Ollama-Only Refactor)
- [x] **LLM Architecture Simplification (Ollama-Only):**
  - [x] Remove provider abstraction layer (`src-tauri/src/core/provider.rs`, trait usage in factory)
  - [x] Simplify `src-tauri/src/llm/factory.rs` â†’ delete/retire file and replace with direct Ollama helpers
  - [x] Keep `src-tauri/src/llm/services/ollama.rs` (no trait impl), expose `test_connection`, `translate`, `get_ollama_models`
  - [x] Simplify models: in `src-tauri/src/models/provider.rs` remove `Provider` enum; reduce `LlmConfig` to `{ model: ModelInfo, base_url?: string, temperature: f32, max_tokens: u32 }`
  - [x] Update commands to call Ollama service directly (`test_llm_connection`, `get_ollama_models`, `translate_text_unit`)
  - [x] Remove `get_available_providers` command and any frontend usage

#### Backend Polish (Phase 7 - Completed)
- [x] Shared LLM state:
  - [x] Added `src-tauri/src/llm/state.rs` with `LlmState` (lazy `OllamaService` + `Semaphore` limiter)
  - [x] Registered managed state in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` via `.manage(LlmState::new(1))`
  - [x] Updated `#[tauri::command] translate_text_unit` to accept and forward `State<LlmState>`
- [x] Command-layer orchestration:
  - [x] Build prompts in `commands/translation.rs` using `PromptBuilder`
  - [x] Implement `translate_with_retry` with 90s timeout and backoff retries
- [x] Service simplification:
  - [x] Added low-level `OllamaService::generate(prompt)`; kept `translate` as legacy wrapper
  - [x] Verified HTTP keep-alive reuse (single "starting new connection" then steady completions)

#### Prompt & Placeholder Pipeline
- [x] **Prompt & Placeholder Pipeline:**
  - [x] Apply `replace_formatting_codes_for_translation()` during extraction in engines (`src-tauri/src/engines/rpg_maker_mv/files/common.rs`) and `restore_formatting_codes_after_translation()` during injection
  - [x] Extend regex mappings in `text_processing.rs` (consumed by `common.rs`):
    - [x] Map `%n` â†’ `[ARG_n]`
    - [x] Handle lowercase control codes: `\v[`, `\c[`, `\n[` 
    - [x] Normalize control codes: `\.` â†’ `[CTRL_DOT]`, `\|` â†’ `[CTRL_WAIT]`, `\^` â†’ `[CTRL_INSTANT]`, `\!` â†’ `[CTRL_INPUT]` (and restore)
    - [x] Preserve original case for variables: `\V[n]` â†’ `[VARIABLE_n]` and `\v[n]` â†’ `[variable_n]`; restore to matching case
  - [x] Prompt loading robustness:
    - [x] Dev: read prompt templates from filesystem (`src-tauri/prompts/`)
    - [x] Prod: embed prompt templates with `include_str!` to avoid path issues
  - [x] Vocabulary filtering by `PromptType`:
    - [x] Implement header-based filtering in `PromptBuilder::filter_vocabulary_sections`
    - [x] Document per-type header whitelist and customization in `README.md`

#### Frontend Core (Ollama-Only UI)
- [x] **Frontend: remove provider selector (Ollama-only UI), adjust `OllamaConfig` type and `providerStore` accordingly (drop `provider`, `api_key`, `extra_config`)**
- [x] **Keep `src-tauri/models/ollama.json` for model list; ensure model selector consumes backend list**
- [x] **Settings page: show connection status dot and last test time; auto-test on mount**
- [x] **Housekeeping: remove unused `@pinia/nuxt` dependency; rename frontend type `ProviderConfig` â†’ `OllamaConfig`; update invokes to `get_ollama_models`**

#### Language Catalog
- [x] **Language Catalog:**
  - [x] Add `src-tauri/models/language.json` with `{ id, label, native_name, dir, enabled }`
  - [x] Backend: load via `include_str!`, expose `get_languages()` command (return only `enabled`)
  - [x] Frontend: language store loads from `get_languages`, apply `dir` (RTL/LTR) in UI when target is RTL

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important for Phase 7 quality)
Core stability tasks moved to Phase 8 (see 8.0)

#### Settings Validation & Error Handling (Frontend Display)
- [x] Gate Translate when invalid; show brief inline error

**Then: batch groundwork â€” moved to Phase 8.3**
**Deferral:** Rate limiting, cache, and auto-backup moved to Phase 8.0; frontend batch groundwork moved to Phase 8.3

## Quick Reference

### Architecture
- **Backend:** Rust + Tauri with trait-based engine system
- **Frontend:** Nuxt.js + Pinia stores (migrating to Nuxt 4 + pnpm)
- **LLM:** Ollama integration with JSON model configs
- **Storage:** Tauri Store plugin for settings

### File Structure
```
src-tauri/src/engines/rpg_maker_mv/files/
â”œâ”€â”€ actors.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ items.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ skills.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ weapons.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ armors.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ classes.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ system.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ states.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ enemies.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ common_events.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ troops.rs âœ…
â””â”€â”€ maps.rs âœ…
```

### Implementation Pattern
Each file follows the same pattern:
1. Define structs matching JSON structure
2. Implement `extract_text()` function using common helpers
3. Implement `inject_translations()` function using common helpers
4. Add to engine file detection
5. Use appropriate prompt types (State, System, Character, etc.)
6. Test with sample project

### Prompt System
- **Base:** `basic.txt` (streamlined core guidelines)
- **Specialized:** `character.txt`, `equipment.txt`, `skill.txt`, `dialogue.txt`, `state.txt`, etc.
- **Vocabulary:** `vocabularies.txt` (game-specific terms)
- **Features:** Direct translation mappings, flexible guidelines, aggressive output formatting

## Key Decisions

### âœ… Completed Optimizations
- **Prompt System:** Consolidated equipment prompts, added specific mappings
- **UI/UX:** Load New Project button, Reset functionality, improved workflow
- **Architecture:** Common helper functions, ~70% code reduction
- **LLM:** Best-of-breed approach with ollama-rs crate
- **Content Filtering:** Smart filtering to reduce translation noise

### ðŸ”„ Current Approach
- **Platform Upgrade:** Nuxt 4 + pnpm migration for enhanced performance
- **Performance Focus:** Backend optimizations and translation workflow improvements
- **User Experience:** Polish existing Nuxt UI components and add advanced features
- **Scalability:** Large-scale translation support with batch processing

## Future Considerations
- **RPG Maker MZ Support** - After platform upgrade completion
- **Additional Engines** - Wolf RPG, etc.
- **Advanced Features** - Batch translation per file type, filtering UI
- **Distribution** - Cross-platform builds and auto-update system
