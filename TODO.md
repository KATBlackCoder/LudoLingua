    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in header with icon, title, description, and actions
    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in body with consistent spacing and layout
    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in footer with save/cancel buttons and status
    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in loading and error states
    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in form validation and submission handling
    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
    - [x] ‚úÖ Built-in responsive design and accessibility
  - [x] ‚úÖ **Supporting Components**:
    - [x] ‚úÖ `ModalHeader.vue` - Standardized modal header with icon, title, and description
    - [x] ‚úÖ `ModalActions.vue` - Standardized modal actions with badge display
    - [x] ‚úÖ `ModalBody.vue` - Standardized modal body with consistent spacing
    - [x] ‚úÖ `ModalFooter.vue` - Standardized modal footer with save/cancel buttons and status
    - [x] ‚úÖ `TextCard.vue` - Reusable text display card with character count and styling
    - [x] ‚úÖ `FormCard.vue` - Reusable form input card with header and footer actions
    - [x] ‚úÖ `MetadataCard.vue` - Reusable metadata display card for configuration sections
- [x] ‚úÖ **Modal Component Analysis**: Analyzed existing modal components for compatibility
  - [x] ‚úÖ **TranslationEditor.vue Analysis**: Perfect match for two-column layout with source/translation cards
  - [x] ‚úÖ **TranslationForm.vue Analysis**: Perfect match for two-column layout with metadata integration
  - [x] ‚úÖ **GlossaryForm.vue Analysis**: Perfect match for two-column layout with configuration sections
  - [x] ‚úÖ **Implementation Strategy**: All three components can be replaced with Modal.vue using slots and props
- [ ] Update `TranslationEditor.vue` to use `Modal.vue` component
  - [ ] Replace custom modal structure with `Modal.vue`
  - [ ] Use two-column layout with source text and translation form cards
  - [ ] Leverage built-in loading and error states
  - [ ] Use custom content slots for re-translate button and prompt type selection
- [x] ‚úÖ Update `TranslationForm.vue` to use `Modal.vue` component
  - [x] ‚úÖ Replace custom modal structure with `Modal.vue`
  - [x] ‚úÖ Use two-column layout with source text and translation form cards
  - [x] ‚úÖ Integrate metadata section with status, file path, and field type
  - [x] ‚úÖ Leverage built-in form validation and submission
  - [x] ‚úÖ Move status utilities to Modal.vue for better encapsulation
  - [x] ‚úÖ Use template ref to access Modal's exposed utilities
- [ ] Update `GlossaryForm.vue` to use `Modal.vue` component
  - [ ] Replace custom modal structure with `Modal.vue`
  - [ ] Use two-column layout with source term and target term cards
  - [ ] Add configuration section with category, language, and enabled settings
  - [ ] Leverage built-in modal behavior and keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Benefits Achieved:
  - [ ] Eliminate 3x modal structure duplication across form components
  - [ ] Consistent modal behavior with shared components
  - [ ] Standardized loading and error states across all modals
  - [ ] Reusable card components for different content types
  - [ ] Centralized modal state management with `useModal.ts`

##### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all refactored components individually
- [ ] Verify no functionality is broken
- [ ] Test responsive behavior across screen sizes
- [ ] Validate accessibility features are preserved

#### Expected Benefits:
- **Reduce Total LOC**: From ~2000 lines to ~800 lines
- **Improve Maintainability**: Single source of truth for common patterns
- **Better Testing**: Isolated, focused components with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistent UX**: Standardized table behavior with TanStack Table
- **Performance**: Shared logic, fewer event listeners, optimized pagination
- **Unified API**: All table components use same pagination and selection systems
- **Modular Design**: Separate selection logic from bulk actions for better reusability
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functions like `translation.ts` eliminate code duplication
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified badge colors, icons, and UI patterns across components
- **Modal Consistency**: Standardized modal behavior across all forms with built-in loading/error states
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminate 3x modal state management duplication across form components

#### Progress Status:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1A Complete**: All shared composables and utilities created
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1B Complete**: All shared components created (FilterCard, TableHeader, TableFooter, BulkActions, ActionButtonGroup, DataTable)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1C Complete**: TranslationResult.vue, TranslationRaw.vue, and TranslationProcess.vue migrated to DataTable
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1D Complete**: GlossaryTable.vue migrated to DataTable with language filter optimization
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1E Complete**: Modal component refactoring - Supporting components created
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1F Complete**: TanStack Table standardization across all components
