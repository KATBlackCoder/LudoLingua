## Quick Reference

### Architecture
- **Backend:** Rust + Tauri with trait-based engine system
- **Frontend:** Nuxt.js + Pinia stores (migrating to Nuxt 4 + pnpm)
- **LLM:** Ollama integration with JSON model configs
- **Storage:** Tauri Store plugin for settings

### File Structure
```
src-tauri/src/engines/rpg_maker_mv/files/
â”œâ”€â”€ actors.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ items.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ skills.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ weapons.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ armors.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ classes.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ system.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ states.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ enemies.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ common_events.rs âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ troops.rs âœ…
â””â”€â”€ maps.rs âœ…
```

### Implementation Pattern
Each file follows the same pattern:
1. Define structs matching JSON structure
2. Implement `extract_text()` function using common helpers
3. Implement `inject_translations()` function using common helpers
4. Add to engine file detection
5. Use appropriate prompt types (State, System, Character, etc.)
6. Test with sample project

### Prompt System
- **Base:** `basic.txt` (streamlined core guidelines)
- **Specialized:** `character.txt`, `equipment.txt`, `skill.txt`, `dialogue.txt`, `state.txt`, etc.
- **Vocabulary:** `vocabularies.txt` (game-specific terms)
- **Features:** Direct translation mappings, flexible guidelines, aggressive output formatting

## Key Decisions

### âœ… Completed Optimizations
- **Prompt System:** Consolidated equipment prompts, added specific mappings
- **UI/UX:** Load New Project button, Reset functionality, improved workflow
- **Architecture:** Common helper functions, ~70% code reduction
- **LLM:** Best-of-breed approach with ollama-rs crate
- **Content Filtering:** Smart filtering to reduce translation noise

### ðŸ”„ Current Approach
- **Platform Upgrade:** Nuxt 4 + pnpm migration for enhanced performance
- **Performance Focus:** Backend optimizations and translation workflow improvements
- **User Experience:** Polish existing Nuxt UI components and add advanced features
- **Scalability:** Large-scale translation support with batch processing

## Future Considerations
- **RPG Maker MZ Support** - After platform upgrade completion
- **Additional Engines** - Wolf RPG, etc.
- **Advanced Features** - Batch translation per file type, filtering UI
- **Distribution** - Cross-platform builds and auto-update system
