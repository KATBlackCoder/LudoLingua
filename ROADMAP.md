#### **✅ Phase 5.0.1: Create Unified Text Processing Pipeline - COMPLETED**
- [x] **Create `utils/text/` Module Structure**:
  - [x] `utils/text/llm_output.rs` - **Smart LLM output cleaning and extraction**
    - [x] `clean_output()` - Smart LLM response cleaning (context-aware)
    - [x] Remove thinking blocks, input/output tags (always safe)
    - [x] Smart artifact removal: only removes clear LLM commentary, not game content
    - [x] Preserves legitimate "Note:", "Explanation:" that are part of game text
    - [x] Quality validation: ensures cleaning doesn't remove all content
  - [x] `utils/text/formatting.rs` - **Universal text handler for all engines**
    - [x] Single `TextFormatter` struct with no engine specification
    - [x] `prepare_for_translation()` - Handles ALL formatting codes AND whitespace patterns directly
    - [x] `restore_after_translation()` - Restores ALL formatting codes AND whitespace patterns directly
    - [x] Replace whitespace with placeholders (don't remove - could break games)
    - [x] Engine-agnostic: works for RPG Maker, Wolf RPG, and any future engines
  - [x] `utils/text/validation.rs` - **Universal validation: common logic for all engines**
    - [x] `ContentValidator` struct - Unified interface for all engines
    - [x] `validate_text()` - Universal validation logic (empty, length, problematic chars, etc.)
    - [x] `get_initial_status()` - Determine status: Pending (needs translation) or Ignored (already in target language)
    - [x] `get_warnings()` - Optional warnings for text that passed validation
    - [x] Translation direction logic: mark text as Ignored if already in target language script
    - [x] Simple and universal: same validation rules for all engines
  - [x] `utils/text/pipeline.rs` - **Unified `TextProcessor` struct with complete processing pipeline**
  - [x] `utils/text/mod.rs` - Public API exports and module organization

- [x] **Implement Complete Processing Pipeline**:
  - [x] `TextProcessor::process_for_extraction()` - Filter → Format → Encode pipeline
  - [x] `TextProcessor::clean_llm_output()` - **Smart LLM response cleaning and extraction**:
    - [x] Move current `clean_model_output` logic from `commands/translator.rs` (lines 322-362)
    - [x] Remove `<think>...</think>`, `<thinking>...</thinking>` blocks (always safe to remove)
    - [x] Remove `<<<INPUT_START>>>` / `<<<INPUT_END>>>` tag artifacts (always safe to remove)
    - [x] Smart artifact removal: only removes clear LLM commentary, not game content
    - [x] Preserves legitimate "Note:", "Explanation:" that are part of game text
    - [x] Context-aware cleaning: distinguishes between LLM artifacts and game content
    - [x] Final cleanup with whitespace normalization and quality validation
  - [x] `TextProcessor::process_for_injection()` - Decode → Restore pipeline
  - [x] **Unified text processing approach**:
    - [x] All engines use same text processing pipeline (engine-agnostic)
    - [x] Formatting codes removed during translation preparation

  - [x] **Each engine**: Remove existing `extract_text_units()` and `inject_text_units()` methods
  - [x] **Each engine**: Add new `extract_raw_text_units()` and `inject_raw_text_units()` methods (file I/O only)
  - [x] **No config needed**: Use unified `TextProcessor` for all engines

- [x] **Automatic Text Processing Integration**:
  - [x] **Public API**: `engine.extract_text_units()` calls core trait default implementation
  - [x] **Core trait**: Calls `engine.extract_raw_text_units()` → processes through unified `TextProcessor` → returns processed `TextUnit`s
  - [x] **Core trait**: Calls `engine.inject_raw_text_units()` after processing through unified `TextProcessor`
  - [x] **Engine implementations**: Focus only on file I/O, no text processing calls
  - [x] **All engines**: Get identical text processing automatically via unified pipeline

    - [x] Remove text processing from `inject_text_units_for_object()`
    - [x] Make these functions work with raw text only

- [x] **Update Export and Frontend Logic for Ignored Status**:
