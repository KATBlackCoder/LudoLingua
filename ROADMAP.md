    - [x] `clean_output()` - Smart LLM response cleaning (context-aware)
    - [x] Remove thinking blocks, input/output tags (always safe)
    - [x] Smart artifact removal: only removes clear LLM commentary, not game content
    - [x] Preserves legitimate "Note:", "Explanation:" that are part of game text
    - [x] Quality validation: ensures cleaning doesn't remove all content
  - [x] `utils/text/formatting.rs` - **Universal text handler for all engines**
    - [x] Single `TextFormatter` struct with no engine specification
    - [x] `prepare_for_translation()` - Handles ALL formatting codes AND whitespace patterns directly
    - [x] `restore_after_translation()` - Restores ALL formatting codes AND whitespace patterns directly
    - [x] Replace whitespace with placeholders (don't remove - could break games)
    - [x] Engine-agnostic: works for RPG Maker, Wolf RPG, and any future engines
  - [x] `utils/text/validation.rs` - **Universal validation: common logic for all engines**
    - [x] `ContentValidator` struct - Unified interface for all engines
    - [x] `validate_text()` - Universal validation logic (empty, length, problematic chars, etc.)
    - [x] `get_initial_status()` - Determine status: Pending (needs translation) or Ignored (already in target language)
    - [x] `get_warnings()` - Optional warnings for text that passed validation
    - [x] Translation direction logic: mark text as Ignored if already in target language script
    - [x] Simple and universal: same validation rules for all engines
  - [x] `utils/text/pipeline.rs` - **Unified `TextProcessor` struct with complete processing pipeline**
  - [x] `utils/text/mod.rs` - Public API exports and module organization

    - [x] Smart artifact removal: only removes clear LLM commentary, not game content
    - [x] Preserves legitimate "Note:", "Explanation:" that are part of game text
    - [x] Context-aware cleaning: distinguishes between LLM artifacts and game content
    - [x] Final cleanup with whitespace normalization and quality validation

    - [x] Remove text processing from `inject_text_units_for_object()`
    - [x] Make these functions work with raw text only

- [x] **Update Export and Frontend Logic for Ignored Status**:
