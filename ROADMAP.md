- [x] RPG Maker MV engine implementation
- [x] Actors.json parsing and display

### âœ… Phase 3: Translation Core & UI
**Goal:** AI translation functionality with complete UI
- [x] LLM integration (Ollama)
- [x] Prompt system with context-aware selection
- [x] Translation workflow and settings management

### âœ… Phase 4: Storage & Architecture
**Goal:** Robust data persistence and architecture improvements
- [x] Tauri Store plugin for settings
- [x] Common helper functions architecture
- [x] ~70% code reduction through abstraction

### âœ… Phase 5: Additional File Types Support
**Goal:** Expand beyond Actors.json to comprehensive RPG Maker MV support
- [x] **6 Core Data Files Completed:**
  - Actors.json âœ…
  - Items.json âœ…  
  - Skills.json âœ…
  - Weapons.json âœ…
  - Armors.json âœ…
  - Classes.json âœ…

### âœ… Phase 5.5: Prompt System Optimization
**Goal:** Improve translation quality and user experience
- [x] Streamlined base prompt (`erobasic.txt`)
- [x] Unified equipment prompts (`equipment.txt`)
- [x] Specific translation mappings for consistency
- [x] Enhanced output formatting
- [x] UI/UX improvements (Load New Project, Reset, etc.)

### âœ… Phase 5.6: System.json Support
**Goal:** Complete System.json file support with proper prompt handling
- [x] System.json parsing and translation extraction
- [x] Complex nested structure handling (terms object)
- [x] Proper prompt type selection (System instead of Other)
- [x] Placeholder preservation in system messages
- [x] Support for 500+ text units from System.json

### âœ… Phase 5.7: Additional RPG Maker MV File Types
**Goal:** Complete comprehensive RPG Maker MV support
- [x] **System Files (High Impact, Easy):**
  - [x] **System.json** - Game title, UI elements, currency, elements
  - [x] **States.json** - Status effect names and descriptions  
  - [x] **Enemies.json** - Enemy names and descriptions
- [x] **Event Files (High Impact, Complex):**
  - [x] **CommonEvents.json** - Common events with dialogue
  - [x] **Troops.json** - Troop names and event commands
- [x] **Map Files (Complex but High Value):**
  - [x] **MapXXX.json** - Individual map files with event dialogue

### âœ… Phase 5.8: Smart Content Filtering & Quality Enhancement
**Goal:** Implement intelligent filtering to reduce translation noise and improve quality
- [x] **Universal Content Filtering:**
  - Extend `is_technical_content()` filtering to all file types
  - Apply smart filtering to field names, descriptions, and notes
  - Filter out technical IDs, placeholders, and non-translatable content
  - Consistent filtering across all RPG Maker MV file types
- [x] **Advanced Filtering Rules:**
  - Single character names (like "ï½˜") - likely placeholders
  - Numeric-only names (like "9") - likely technical IDs
  - Short technical abbreviations (HP, MP, ATK, etc.)
  - File paths and asset references
  - JavaScript code and expressions
  - Developer markers and comments
- [x] **Quality Improvements:**
  - Reduce translation noise by filtering technical content
  - Focus translation efforts on actual player-facing text
  - Improve translation consistency by removing edge cases
  - Better separation of translatable vs. technical content
