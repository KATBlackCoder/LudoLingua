# ROADMAP

## 🎯 LudoLingua Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Selective Translation Injection (Current Priority)
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

#### Objective
Implement selective injection functionality that allows users to choose specific translations to inject rather than performing a global injection of all translated content.

#### Key Deliverables

##### 1. Enhanced Selection System
- **Multi-Select Translation Units**: Allow users to select specific translation units for injection
- **Batch Selection**: Support selecting multiple translations by criteria (status, file type, etc.)
- **Visual Selection Indicators**: Clear UI indicators showing what's selected for injection
- **Selection Persistence**: Maintain selection state across navigation and filtering

##### 2. Selective Injection UI
- **Injection Dialog**: Create modal for selective injection with preview
- **Injection Preview**: Show which files will be modified and what translations will be injected
- **Injection Options**: Allow users to choose injection scope (selected items only)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator during selective injection

##### 3. Backend Injection Logic
- **Selective Injection API**: Modify backend to accept specific translation unit IDs
- **Partial File Updates**: Update only the files containing selected translations
- **Injection Validation**: Validate selected translations before injection
- **Rollback Support**: Ability to undo selective injections

##### 4. Integration Points
- **Translation Tables**: Add selection checkboxes and bulk injection actions
- **Translation Editor**: Add "Inject Selected" option to individual translation editor
- **Glossary System**: Selective injection for glossary terms
- **Export System**: Modify export to support selective translation injection

#### Success Metrics
- [ ] Users can select 1-1000+ specific translations for injection
- [ ] Injection process takes <30 seconds for typical selections
- [ ] 100% accuracy in selective injection (no unintended changes)
- [ ] Clear visual feedback during injection process
- [ ] Support for both single-item and bulk selective injection

#### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Modify `export_translated_subset` to accept translation unit IDs
- [ ] Update database queries to fetch specific translation units
- [ ] Enhance UI selection components with injection actions
- [ ] Add injection preview and confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Implement progress tracking for selective injection operations
