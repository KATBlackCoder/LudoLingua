- ✅ **Nuxt UI v4**: Used latest components and established patterns

**Components Created:**
- [x] `app/components/translations/TranslationTable.vue` (based on GlossaryTable)
- [x] `app/components/translations/TranslationForm.vue` (based on GlossaryForm)
- [x] `app/pages/translations.vue` (simple page like glossary)
- [x] `app/composables/useTranslations.ts` (based on useGlossary)
- [x] Add navigation integration

**Advanced Features Added:**
- [x] Row selection with checkboxes using official Nuxt UI v4 pattern
- [x] Bulk delete functionality with proper selection management
- [x] Native Tauri dialog confirmations for reliable operations
