# Project Documentation Update Policy

Always keep the project's documentation up-to-date.

After any significant change, modification, or update to the codebase, you **must** update the following files to reflect the changes:

*   `[CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md)`: Document all user-facing or notable technical changes here, following the Keep a Changelog format.
*   `[PROGRESS.MD](mdc:PROGRESS.MD)`: Update this file to mark the completion of milestones or tasks as defined in the project roadmap.
