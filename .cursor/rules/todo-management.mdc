# TODO.md Management Rules

## File Structure Requirements

### Phase Organization
- Use clear phase headers with priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Include objective statements for each phase
- Group related tasks under logical phases
- Reference: [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md)

### Task Format Standards
```markdown
- [ ] **Task Title**: Brief description of what needs to be done
- [ ] **Implementation Details**: Technical requirements and specifications
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and completion requirements
```

### Priority Indicators
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate fixes and blocking issues
- **HIGH**: Important features and major improvements  
- **MEDIUM**: Nice-to-have features and optimizations
- **LOW**: Future enhancements and technical debt

## Content Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- Include specific file paths and function names
- Provide code examples and implementation details
- Reference related files using `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)` format
- Include success metrics and measurable outcomes

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Add**: New tasks with complete technical details
2. **Update**: Modify tasks as requirements change
3. **Complete**: Mark with `[x]` and move to CHANGELOG.md
4. **Remove**: Delete completed tasks to prevent clutter

### Cross-Reference Integration
- Link to related ROADMAP.md phases
- Reference PROGRESS.MD milestones
- Connect to CHANGELOG.md entries for completed work
- Maintain consistency with project architecture documentation
