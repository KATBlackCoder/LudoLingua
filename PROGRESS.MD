## 🎯 **Current Status: Phase 10.1.14 - TranslationForm.vue Modal Migration (100% Complete)**

**Latest Achievement:** Successfully completed Phase 10.1.14 with TranslationForm.vue modal component migration. Replaced custom modal structure with shared Modal.vue component using two-column layout with source text and translation form cards. Integrated metadata section with status, file path, and field type. Moved status utilities to Modal.vue for better encapsulation and used template ref to access Modal's exposed utilities. Eliminated modal structure duplication and established consistent modal behavior.

**Next Priority:** Phase 10.1.15 - Implement modal component migrations for TranslationEditor.vue and GlossaryForm.vue.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Phase 10.1 Complete!** 🎉
Component architecture refactoring successfully implemented with shared composables, utility functions, and reusable components that eliminate code duplication and establish a scalable foundation for future development. Row selection data mapping fix ensures professional-grade table functionality with proper bulk operations support.

### **Immediate Priority (Phase 10.2)**
1. **Refactor Existing Components**
   - Break down `TranslationResult.vue` (812 lines → 4 components)
   - ✅ Removed `TranslationTable.vue` (replaced by modern `TranslationView.vue`)
   - Simplify `GlossaryTable.vue` (282 lines → ~100 lines)
   - Migrate all table components to use shared architecture

2. **Modal Component Refactoring**
   - Update `TranslationEditor.vue` to use `useModal.ts`
   - Update `TranslationForm.vue` to use `useModal.ts`
   - Update `GlossaryForm.vue` to use `useModal.ts`
   - Standardize modal props and events across all forms

3. **TanStack Table Standardization**
   - Migrate `TranslationRaw.vue` to TanStack Table pagination
   - Migrate `TranslationProcess.vue` to TanStack Table pagination
   - Standardize all table components to use shared DataTable.vue

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test all refactored components individually
   - Verify no functionality is broken
   - Test responsive behavior across screen sizes
   - Validate accessibility features are preserved

### **Future Phases**
- **Phase 11**: Advanced Translation Management Features
- **Phase 12**: Performance Optimization & Virtual Scrolling
- **Phase 13**: Quality Assurance & Testing
