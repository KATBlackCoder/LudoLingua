        *   Created `assets/css/main.css` for global styles.
        *   Wrapped application in `UApp` component for proper Nuxt UI configuration.
        *   Updated layout structure to follow Nuxt best practices with proper slot usage.
    *   [x] **Backend:**
        *   Set up `src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs` with the Tauri builder.
        *   Created `src/core/mod.rs` and `src/core/error.rs`.
        *   Created `src/commands/mod.rs` and `src/commands/handler.rs`.
        *   Registered the command handler in `lib.rs`.
        *   Added a sample `hello` command to test frontend-backend communication.

        *   [x] Updated `Engine` trait to include `as_any` method for downcasting to specific engine implementations.
        *   [x] Fixed Actors.json parsing to match the actual file structure.
        *   [x] Added extraction of note field from actors as translatable text.
        *   [x] Enhanced Actor struct with default values and flexible field handling to accommodate varying JSON structures.
        *   [x] Added proper field name mapping using serde rename attributes for camelCase JSON fields.
        *   [x] Added missing fields (equips, traits) and additional derive traits to the Actor struct.
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   [x] Created `types/engine.ts` with TypeScript interfaces matching the Rust structs.
        *   [x] Created `types/translation.ts` with TypeScript interfaces matching the Rust structs.
